# Project Idea
*by Andrew Lay*
## Summery
I had the Idea to create a Chess algorithm. What a chess algorithm will do is be able to play chess. This is pretty much all it does but this is very powerful. The program that I want to make should be able to do a couple of things. The first thing is play chess against a human. So this would take input from the user and be able to make the best move based on the users move. This would also mean that the program can also play against other algorithms. The program should also be able to let two players play chess and analyze the moves. This would mean that the program analyzes the board at any point in the game and gives a numeric score.

## What problem does this solve
The problem that this solves is to allow one player to play against a competent opponent without playing online. The other problem that it would solve is being able to understand chess games from an objective view.

## Languages
- c++
- Something for the GUI?
